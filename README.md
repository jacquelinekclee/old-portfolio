## About Me

!(headshot)[assets/images/tcg_headshot.jpg]

Hello! I'm Jacqueline and currently finished my B.S. in Data Science with minors in Economics and Business at UC San Diego. While my love-affiar with numbers and data started when I was a young basketball player and fan looking up my favorite teams' stats, today I love leveraging data to explain, solve, and/or even highlight important problems and questions. Ever since I opened my first Jupyter Notebook back in September 2019, I haven't looked back!

On this website, you'll learn more about my experiences and personal projects I've done! Thanks for visiting :)
